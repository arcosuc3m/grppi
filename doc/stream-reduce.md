# Stream reduction pattern

The **stream reduction** pattern consists on the use of the reduce pattern over
a stream of data. Each element is processed using a reduce operator, that
generates a new output element. The output elements are sent to an output
stream.  This streaming pattern can only be used inside another pattern and
consequently does not take an execution policy itself, but uses the execution
policy of its enclosing pattern.

The interface to the **stream reduction** pattern is provided by function 
`grppi::stream_reduce()`. 

~~~{.cpp}
grppi::pipeline(ex
  stage1,
  grppi::stream_reduce(arguments...),
  stage2,
  stage3,
  ...)
~~~

## Stream reduction variants

* *Composable stream reduce*: Defines a stream reduce that can be used as a building 
block by another pattern (e.g. a pipeline).

## Key elements in stream reduction

The key elements in a **stream reduction** is the **Combiner** operation, the 
**window size** and the **offset**.

A **Combiner** is any C++ callable entity, that is able to combine two values
into a single value.
A **Combiner** `cmb` is any operation taking two values `x` and
`y` of types `T` and `U` and returning a combined value of type `T`, making valid
the following:

~~~{.cpp}
T x;
U y;
T res = cmb(x,y);
~~~

A **window size** is an integer value that defines the number of elements that should
be collapsed to produce a resulting value.

An **offset** is an integer value that defines the overlapping degree among windows.

## Details on stream reduction variants

### Composable stream reduction

A composable stream reduction has four elements:

* A **window size**.
* An **offset**.
* An **identity value** provided as an input value.
* A **Combiner** combining two values into a single value.

The input values will be generated by the upper level pattern, which will be also 
responsible for consuming the output values.

**Example**: A stream reduction stage in a pipeline.
~~~{.cpp}
grppi::pipeline(exec,
  stageA,
  stageB,
  grppi::stream_reduce(
    window_size, offset, 0,
    [](int x, int y) { return x+y; }),
  stageC
  );
~~~

**Note**: For brevity we do not show here the details of other stages.

For composing complex patterns, the **stream_reduce()** function may be used to 
create an object that may be supplied to another pattern to build a composed pattern.

**Example**: A composable stream reduction stage in a pipeline.
~~~{.cpp}
auto chunk_sum = grppi::stream_reduce(
  window_size, offset, 0,
  [](int x, int y) { return x+y; });

grppi::pipeline(exec,
  stageA,
  stageB,
  chunk_sum,
  stageC
  );
