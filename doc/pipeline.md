# Pipeline pattern

The **pipeline** pattern receives a data stream that is processed in several
stages. Each stage processes the data produced by the previous stage and delivers
its result to the next stage.

The interface to the **pipeline** pattern is provided by function
`grppi::pipeline()`. As all functions in *GrPPI*, this function takes as its
first argument an execution policy.

~~~{.cpp}
grppi::pipeline(exec, other_arguments...);
~~~

Additionally, there is a variant where the execution policy may be omitted. This
variant is meant to be used in pipeline nesting.

~~~{.cpp}
grppi::pipeline(arguments...);
~~~

## Pipeline variants

There are several variants:

* *Standalone pipeline*: Is a top level pipeline. Invoking the algorithm runs the
pipeline.
* *Composable pipeline*: Builds a pipeline object that can be later inserted
into another pattern.

## Key elements in pipeline

The key elements in a **pipeline** are the **Generator** producing data items
and the **Transformer** stages.

A **Generator** is any C++ callable entity that takes zero arguments and
produces data items from a given type. Thus, a **Generator** `gen` is any
operation that, given an output type `U`, makes valid the following:

~~~{.cpp}
U res{gen()};
//...
if (res) { /* ... */ }  // If res holds a value
if (!res) { /* ... */ } // If res does not hold a value
auto value = * res;     // Get value held by res
~~~

A **Transformer** is any C++ callable entity that takes a data item and
transforms it. The input type and the output type may differ. Thus, a 
transformer `op` is any operation that, given an input `x` of type `T` and output type
`U`, makes valid the following:

~~~{.cpp}
U res {op(x)};
~~~

## Details on pipeline variants


### Standalone pipeline

A *standalone pipeline* generates data from a source and passes the output to
the first stage that applies a transformation to each data item. The resulting
items are passed to the next stage and so on.

Consequently, a pipeline with a **Generator** `gen` and `N` **Transformer**
*stages* (`s1, s2, ..., sN`) performs the following computation:

~~~
sN(...s2(s1(gen())))
~~~

**Note**: Each stage may run concurrently with other stages. However, there are
dependencies between stages, so that every item passes sequentially across
stages.

---
**Example**: Generate a sequence of integers, apply consecutive transformations (from int to double
and from double to string), and write to standard output.
~~~{.cpp}
int n = 100;
grppi::pipeline(e, 
  [n]() -> optional<double> { 
    static int x = 0;
    if (x<n) return x++;
    else return {}; 
  },
  [](double x) { return x*x; },
  [](double x) { return 1/x; },
  [](double x) { cout << x << endl; }
);
~~~
---

### Composable pipeline

A *composable pipeline* returns a representation of the pipeline that can be
used to perform declarative composition of streaming patterns.

A composable pipeline does not take an execution policy as it inherits the
execution policy from its enclosing pattern.

---
**Example**: Use a farm to read intenger from a file and write to another file
strings. The transformation phase is a pipeline that performs transformation in
two stages.
~~~{.cpp}
grppi::farm(ex1,
  [&input]() -> optional<int> {
    int n;
    input >> n;
    if (!input) return {};
    else return n;
  },
  grppi::pipeline(
    [](int x) -> double { return func1(x); },
    [](double x) -> string { return func2(x); },
  ),
  [&output](string s) {
    output << s << endl;
  }
);  
~~~
---

This *composable pipeline* can also be used to build complex composed patterns
in a non-declarative way.

---
**Example**: Piecewise construction of a farm of pipelines.
~~~{.cpp}
auto reader = [&input]() -> optional<int> {
  int n;
  input >> n;
  if (!input) return {};
  else return n;
};

auto processor = grppi::pipeline(
  [](int x) -> double { return func1(x); },
  [](double x) -> string { return func2(x); },
);

auto writer = [&output](string s) {
  output << s << "\n";
};

grppi::farm(ex1, reader, processor, writer);
~~~
