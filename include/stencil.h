 *  @brief Apply the stencil pattern for parallelizing the code section.
 *
 *  The Stencil pattern is applied in data structures when the computations
 *  need information about other elements of the data structures.
 *  The Stencil divide the data structure in as many parts as threads are 
 *  available to be used. Then each threads perform the computation needed for
 *  each neighbor of that element using the 'neighbor' function and perform 
 *  the code section 'taskf' with the data computed with the neighbors.
