\brief Thread index table to provide portable natural thread indices.

A thread table provides a simple way to offer thread indices (starting from 0).

When a thread registers itself in the registry, its id is added to the vector 
of identifiers. When a thread deregisters itself from the registry its entry
is modified to contain the empty thread id.

To get an integer index, users may call `current_index`, which provides the order
number of the calling thread in the registry.
