/** @defgroup Mapreduce
 *
 *  @brief Apply the mapreduce pattern for parallelizing the code section.
 *
 *	The Mapreduce pattern is based on the application of a function 'map' 
 *	to all the elements of a given data structures 'in', and then merge
 * 	the result to another variable using binary elemental operations.
 *	In a Mapreduce the datastructure is divided in as many data sections as 
 *	threads are available to be used by the function that will execute in
 *	in parallel the code section 'map'. Each task will reduce its own 
 *	data section. Finaly all the thread section will be join in an output 
 *	variable.
