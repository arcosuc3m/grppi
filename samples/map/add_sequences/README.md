**add_sequence**

This example generates a sequence with the addition of the first *n* natural
numbers and it corresponding squares. So, for each number *i*, the example
computes the number

~~~
i + i^2
~~~

This program performs the following steps:

1. Create a sequence with the first *n* natural numbers.
2. Create a sequence with the first *n* squares of natural numbers.
3. Computes the addition of both sequence element-wise.
4. Prints the resulting sequence.
