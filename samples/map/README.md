This directory offers the following examples:

* **double_sequence**: Given the sequence of the first *n* natural numbers, 
compute a sequence with doubles of those numbers.

* **add_sequences**: Given the sequence of the first *n* natural numbers,
and the sequences of the first *n* squares of natural numbers,
compute a sequence with the addition of those sequence element by element.

* **daxpy**: Generate two random double precission vectors of size *n*
and a random doulbe precission coefficiente and compute the BLAS daxpy 
operation (`y = a * x + y`).
